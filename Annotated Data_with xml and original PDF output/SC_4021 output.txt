Precedent Referred : Against the orders passed by the High Court the Commissioner appeals to this Court.This Court in a recent judgment-C. A. Abraham v. Income-tax Officer, Kottayam (1)-held that the Income-tax Officer had power under s. 28 of the Income-tax Act to impose penalty in the course of assessment of a firm even if the firm stood at the date of the order dissolved by the death of one of its partners.

Precedent Referred : This Court in C. A. Abraham's case approved the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Mareddy Krishna Reddy v. Income-tax Officer, Tenali, (1) which was a case of a registered firm, which was dissolved before imposition of penalty.Counsel then argued that in any event, no penalty under s. 28 can be imposed against a registered firm either before or after dissolution, even if the defaults set out in cls.

Precedent Referred : To the imposition on of a penalty liability to pay tax by the person against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed is therefore not a condition precedent.The Calcutta High Court in Khushiram Murarilal v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Central Calcutta (1) was called upon to deal with the submission made before us in this case.
