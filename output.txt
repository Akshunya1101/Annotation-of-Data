Division of District into electoral division.-(1) The State Election Commission shall, for the purposes of election of Councillors divide every District; into electoral divisions (the territorial extent of any such division not being outside the limits of the same Block), each returning one Councillor, and there shall be a separate election for each electoral division:

Provided that, such electoral division shall be divided in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each electoral division and the total number of Councillors to be elected for the Zilla Parishad shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout the Zilla Parishad area:

Provided further that, while distributing such electoral divisions among the Panchayat Samitis, not less than two electoral divisions shall be allotted to each Panchayat Samiti.

(2)(a) In the seats to be filled in by election in a Zilla Parishad there shall be seats reserved for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Class of citizens and women, as may be determined by the State Election Commission in the prescribed manner:

(b) the seats to be reserved for the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in a Zilla Parishad shall bear, as nearly as may be, the same proportion to the total number of seats to be filled in by direct election in that Zilla Parishad as the population of the Scheduled Castes or, as the case may be, the Scheduled Tribes in that Zilla Parsishad area bears to the total population of that area and such seats shall be allotted by rotation to different electoral divisions in a Zilla Parishad:

Provided that, in a Zilla Parishad comprising entirely the Scheduled Areas, the seats to be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes shall not be less than one-half of the total number of seats in the Zilla Parishad:

Provided further that, the reservation for the Scheduled Tribes in a Zilla Parishad falling only partially in the Scheduled Areas shall be in accordance with the provisions of clause (b):

Provided also that one-half of the total number of seats so reserved shall be reserved for women belonging to the Scheduled Castes or, as the case may be, the Scheduled Tribes:

(c) the seats to be reserved for persons belonging to the category of Backward Class of Citizens shall be 27 per cent. of the total number of seats to be filled in by election in a Zilla Parishad and such seats shall be allotted by rotation to different electoral divisions in a Zilla Parishad :

Provided further that, the reservation for the persons belonging to the Backward Class of Citizens in a Zilla Parishad falling only partially in the Scheduled Areas shall be in accordance with the provisions of clause (c) :

Provided also that one-half of the total number of seats so reserved shall be reserved for women belonging to the category of Backward Class of Citizens:

(d) one-half (including the number of seats reserved for women belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the category of Backward Class of Citizens) of the total number of seats to be filled in by direct election in a Zilla Parishad shall be reserved for women and such seats shall be allotted by rotation to different electoral divisions in a Zilla Parishad.

(3) The reservation of seats (other than the reservation for women) under sub-section (2) shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period specified in Article 334 of the Constitution of India."

"9. In light of the submissions that have been paraphrased in the subsequent paragraphs, the contentious issues in this case can be framed in the following manner:

(i) Whether Article 243-D(6) and Article 243-T(6) are constitutionally valid since they enable reservations in favour of backward classes for the purpose of occupying seats and chairperson positions in panchayats and municipalities respectively?

(ii) Whether Article 243-D(4) and Article 243-T(4) are constitutionally valid since they enable the reservation of chairperson positions in panchayats and municipalities respectively?"

(emphasis supplied)

"60. There is no doubt in our minds that excessive and disproportionate reservations provided by the State legislations can indeed be the subject-matter of specific challenges before the courts. However, the same does not justify the striking down of Articles 243-D(6) and 243-T(6) which are constitutional provisions that enable reservations in favour of backward classes in the first place. As far as the challenge against the various State legislations is concerned, we were not provided with adequate materials or argumentation that could help us to make a decision about the same. The identification of backward classes for the purpose of reservations is an executive function and as per the mandate of Article 340, dedicated commissions need to be appointed to conduct a rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness.

61. It is also incumbent upon the executive to ensure that reservation policies are reviewed from time to time so as to guard against overbreadth. In respect of the objections against the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, all that we can refer to is the Chinnappa Reddy Commission Report (1990) which reflects the position as it existed twenty years ago. In the absence of updated empirical data, it is well-nigh impossible for the courts to decide whether the reservations in favour of OBC groups are proportionate or not.

62. Similarly, in the case of the State of Uttar Pradesh, the claims about the extent of the OBC population are based on the 1991 census. Reluctant as we are to leave these questions open, it goes without saying that the petitioners are at liberty to raise specific challenges against the State legislations if they can point out flaws in the identification of backward classes with the help of updated empirical data.

63. As noted earlier, social and economic backwardness does not necessarily coincide with political backwardness. In this respect, the State Governments are well advised to reconfigure their reservation policies, wherein the beneficiaries under Articles 243-D(6) and 243-T(6) need not necessarily be coterminous with the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) [for the purpose of Article 15(4)] or even the backward classes that are underrepresented in government jobs [for the purpose of Article 16(4)]. It would be safe to say that not all of the groups which have been given reservation benefits in the domain of education and employment need reservations in the sphere of local self-government. This is because the barriers to political participation are not of the same character as barriers that limit access to education and employment. This calls for some fresh thinking and policy-making with regard to reservations in local self-government."

(emphasis supplied)

"67. In the recent decision reported as Union of India v. Rakesh Kumar [(2010) 4 SCC 50 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 961 : (2010) 1 Scale 281] this Court has explained why it may be necessary to provide reservations in favour of the Scheduled Tribes that exceed 50% of the seats in panchayats located in the Scheduled Areas. However, such exceptional considerations cannot be invoked when we are examining the quantum of reservations in favour of backward classes for the purpose of local bodies located in general areas. In such circumstances, the vertical reservations in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs cannot exceed the upper limit of 50% when taken together. It is obvious that in order to adhere to this upper ceiling, some of the States may have to modify their legislations so as to reduce the quantum of the existing quotas in favour of OBCs."

(emphasis supplied)

"Conclusion

82. In view of the above, our conclusions are:

(i) The nature and purpose of reservations in the context of local self-government is considerably different from that of higher education and public employment. In this sense, Article 243-D and Article 243-T form a distinct and independent constitutional basis for affirmative action and the principles that have been evolved in relation to the reservation policies enabled by Articles 15(4) and 16(4) cannot be readily applied in the context of local self-government. Even when made, they need not be for a period corresponding to the period of reservation for the purposes of Articles 15(4) and 16(4), but can be much shorter.

(ii) Article 243-D(6) and Article 243-T(6) are constitutionally valid since they are in the nature of provisions which merely enable the State Legislatures to reserve seats and chairperson posts in favour of backward classes. Concerns about disproportionate reservations should be raised by way of specific challenges against the State legislations.

(iii) We are not in a position to examine the claims about overbreadth in the quantum of reservations provided for OBCs under the impugned State legislations since there is no contemporaneous empirical data. The onus is on the executive to conduct a rigorous investigation into the patterns of backwardness that act as barriers to political participation which are indeed quite different from the patterns of disadvantages in the matter of access to education and employment. As we have considered and decided only the constitutional validity of Articles 243-D(6) and 243-T(6), it will be open to the petitioners or any aggrieved party to challenge any State legislation enacted in pursuance of the said constitutional provisions before the High Court. We are of the view that the identification of "backward classes" under Article 243-D(6) and Article 243-T(6) should be distinct from the identification of SEBCs for the purpose of Article 15(4) and that of backward classes for the purpose of Article 16(4).

(iv) The upper ceiling of 50% vertical reservations in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs should not be breached in the context of local self-government. Exceptions can only be made in order to safeguard the interests of the Scheduled Tribes in the matter of their representation in panchayats located in the Scheduled Areas.

(v) The reservation of chairperson posts in the manner contemplated by Articles 243-D(4) and 243-T(4) is constitutionally valid. These chairperson posts cannot be equated with solitary posts in the context of public employment."

"COUNTER AFFIDAVIT ON BEHALF OF

RESPONDENT

I, D.D. Shinde age 55 years, Occ. Service, presently working as Deputy Commissioner (Establishment) in the office of Divisional Commissioner, Nashik, Maharashtra, do hereby submit on solemn affirmation as under that:-

1. I am the authorized officer of the respondent in the present Special Leave Petition. I am also authorized to file Counter Affidavit on behalf of Respondent as such I am well conversant with the facts and circumstances of the case and hence I am competent and authorized to swear this Counter Affidavit on behalf of the Respondent.

2. I have gone through the contents of the present Special Leave Petition in reply thereto the answering Respondent seeks to file this Counter Affidavit in order to oppose the averments and contentions of the Special Leave Petition with liberty of this Hon'ble Court to file a further Counter Affidavit as and when necessary and with the permission of this Hon'ble Court.

3. The State Government has filed affidavits dated 5.11.2019 and 13.03.2020, and I repeat and reiterate the contents of the same as if the same have been set out herein, in extenso. I say that I am filing this Affidavit in compliance of the directions of the Hon'ble Court in its order dated 19.01.2021, passed in the above Special Leave Petition.

4. I say that the elections were held to the Zilla Parishads of five districts in Maharashtra, namely Nagpur, Washim, Akola, Dhule and Nandurbar in December 2019/January 2020, pursuant to the orders passed by this Hon'ble Court. In all the aforesaid districts, the reservation exceeded 50%. It is the contention of the Petitioners that in all the aforesaid districts the reservation could not have exceeded 50% as it was the upper limit as set out in the judgments of Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India reported in (1992) 3 SCC 217 and the judgment of K. Krushnamurthy vs. Union of India reported in (2010) 7 SCC 202. The only issue that essentially remains for consideration of this Hon'ble Court, in all these matters is whether the reservation in all the aforesaid five districts could have exceeded 50%.

5. I repeat and reiterate that the elections held in December 2019/January 2020 have been held on the basis of the old dispensation, but for future elections, the State Government will have to provide category wise breakup of population and in particular regarding Backward Class Category (BCC), as the information can be provided only by the Central Government. It is therefore submitted that, I.A. No.188324/2019 be allowed and the Registrar General of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India and the Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice and Welfare be added as party respondents in the aforesaid Special Leave Petitions. It is further submitted that, I.A. No.188318/2019 be allowed and the Registrar General of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India and the Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice and Welfare be directed to make available the data of Socio-Economic Census 2011, to the extent only relating to the caste of the citizens of Rural Maharashtra, to enable the Government of Maharashtra to calculate population belonging to castes that make a part of Backward Classes of Citizens (BCC) in Maharashtra.

6. I repeat and reiterate with regard to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Hon'ble Court in K. Krishnamurthy (supra), and in particular paragraph no.83(iv) thereof, it is submitted with respect that, a reading of paragraphs no.59, 64, 66 and 67 thereof, create a doubt as to whether 50% vertical reservations referred to in paragraph no.82(iv) can be regarded as unalterable. A breakup of the figures in respect of the five districts (mentioned in the order dated 18.12.2019) show that if the direction given in paragraph no.82(iv) are to be strictly complied with, it may not be possible to give effect thereto, at least in respect of Dhule and Nandurbar districts which have high tribal population.

7. I submit that in the case of K. Krushna Murthy (Supra) the Hon'ble Constitution Bench of this Hon'ble Court lays down that the nature and purpose of reservations in the context of local self-government is considerably different from that of higher education and public employment. It further lays down that Article 243-D and Article 243-T form a distinct and independent constitutional basis for affirmative action and the principle that have been evolved in relation to the reservation policies enabled by Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution, cannot be readily applied in the context of local self-government.

8. I submit that in the absence of explicit constitutional guidance as to the quantum of reservation in favour of backward classes in local self-government, the rule of thumb is that of 'proportionate reservation'. Admittedly, reservations in excess of 50% do exist in some exceptional cases, when it comes to the domain of political representation, which is the outcome of exceptional considerations in relation to these areas. Similarly, vertical reservations in excess of 50% are permissible in the composition of local self-government institutions located in the Fifth Schedule Areas. I submit that in the judgment of Union of India v. Rakesh Kumar reported in (2010) 4 SCC 50, this Hon'ble Court has explained why it may be necessary to provide reservations in favour of the Scheduled Tribes that exceed 50% of the seats in local self-governments located in the Scheduled Area.

9. With regard to the elections held in December 2019/January 2020, in Nandurbar district, 44 out of 56 seats were reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) category which was in keeping with the population ratio. This itself consumed 50% upper limit provided by the Constitution Bench of this Hon'ble Court, leaving 1 reservation for Scheduled Caste (SC) Category. In respect of elections held in December 2019/January 2020, in Dhule district, 23 out of 56 seats were reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) category which was in keeping with the population ratio. This itself consumed 50% upper limit provided by the Constitution Bench of this Hon'ble Court, leaving 3 reservation for Scheduled Caste (SC) Category. In Dhule District the talukas of Saktri and Shirpur are partly 'Scheduled Areas'. In Nandurbar District, the talukas of Navapur, Taloda, Akkalkuwa and Akrani are fully 'Scheduled Areas' and the blocks of Nandurbar and Shahda are partly 'Scheduled Areas'. I say that both Dhule and Nandurbar Districts, being partly 'Scheduled Areas' would fall within the exceptions laid down in the case of Indra Sawhney (Supra). Further, the decision of Indra Sawhney (Supra) was given in respect of reservation measures enabled by Article 16(4) of the Constitution. The principles of reservation which are applicable for public employment and for admission to educational institutions cannot be readily applied in respect of a reservation policy made to protect the interests of the Scheduled Tribes by assuring them of majority of reservation in Scheduled Areas. Further, the case of Indra Sawhney (Supra) reveals that though an upper limit of 50% was prescribed for reservations in public employment, the said decision recognizes the need of exceptional treatment in some circumstances. The case of Indra Sawhney (supra) prescribes an upper limit of 50% (in paragraph 806 of the judgment) because Article 16(4) deals with 'adequate representation' and not 'proportionate representation'. Hence, the elections held in December 2019/January 2020 ought not to set aside for the districts of Dhule and Nandurbar districts.

10. In any event, as set out in detail in the Affidavit dated 13.3.2020, I say that the State Government is unable to provide category wise breakup of population and in particular regarding Backward Class Category (BCC), as that information can be provided only by the Central Government and the same is not forthcoming. It is important that the data of Socio-Economic to the extent only of field relating to the caste of the citizens of Rural Maharashtra, be provided to the State Government by the Central Government, so as to enable the State Government to calculate population belonging to castes that make a part of Backward Caste of Citizens (BCC) in Maharashtra. With regard to the elections held in December 2019/January 2020, in Nagpur, Washim, and Akola districts, the reservations exceeded 50% of the seats, only by 6% to 8% and ought not to be set aside by this Hon'ble Court.

11. I repeat and reiterate that it is important that the data of Socio-Economic to the extent only of field relating to the caste of the citizens of Rural Maharashtra, be provided to the State Government by the Central Government, so as to enable the State Government to calculate population belonging to castes that make a part of Backward Caste of Citizens (BCC) in Maharashtra.

12. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, the special leave petition deserves to be dismissed.

13. That no new additional facts or documents, which are not part of the record are stated or annexed in the counter affidavit.

Hence this Counter Affidavit.
