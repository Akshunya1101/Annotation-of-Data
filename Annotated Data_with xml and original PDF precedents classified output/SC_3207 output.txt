July 29, 1964. The Judgment was delivered by SHAH-- M/S. Chugandas and Co a firm dealing in securities- received in the year 1946 Rs. 4, 13, 992/- as interest on securities held by it. In 1947 it received Rs. 1, 01, 229/- as interest from the same source. On June 30, 1947 the firm discontinued its business. In proceedings for assessment for 1947-48 and 1948-49 the firm, relying upon s. 25(3) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, claimed exemption from payment of tax on income earned in the relevant previous year, on the plea that the firm was carrying on business before the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, was enacted, and on that business, tax had been charged under the provisions of the Indian Incometax Act 7 of 1918 in respect of the business done immediately before that Act was repealed. The firm also applied to substitute the income earned in the year 1947 for the income of the previous year. The Income- tax Officer held that the interest earned by the firm on securities being "liable to be assessed to tax" under s. 8 and not under s. 10 of the Income-tax Act, the firm was not entitled to the benefit of the exemption claimed. The order of the Income-tax Officer was confirmed in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, however, reversed the order and held that the firm was entitled to the benefit of the exemption in respect of the entire income of the business including income from securities in the year in which the business was discontinued.
"Whether the assessee is entitled to the benefit of s. 25(3) in respect of the interest on securities?"
"Where any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1918 (VII of 1918), is discontinued, then, unless there has been a succession by virtue of which the provisions of sub-section (4) have been rendered applicable, no tax shall be payable in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such discontinuance, and the assessee may further claim that the income, profits and gains of the previous year shall be deemed to have been the income, profits and gains of the said period. Where any such claim is made, an assessment shall be made on the basis of the income, profits and gains of the said period, and if an amount of tax has already been paid in respect of the income, profits and gains of the previous year exceeding the amount payable on the basis of such assessment, a refund shall be given of the difference."

1959 SCR 79
"the scheme of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, is that the various heads of income, profits and gains enumerated in s. 6 are mutually exclusive, each head being specific to cover the item) arising from a particular source and, consequently, "interest on securities" which is specifically made chargeable to tax under s. 8 as a distinct head, falls under that section and cannot be brought under s. 10, whether the securities are held as trading assets or capital asset."

"different heads; they are derived from different sources; and the income is computed under different methods. The fact that the capital gains are connected with the capital assets of the business cannot make them the profit of the business. They are only deemed to be income of the previous year and not the profit or gains arising from the business during that year."Dealing with s. 26(2) it was observed:- the expression" profits"
