HELD: That where the evidence of the approver is held not to be very helpful to the prosecution other circumstances besides the evidence of the approver has to be considered. The mere fact that the dead body was pointed out by the appellant or was discovered as a result of a statement made by him would not necessarily lead to the conclusion of the offence of murder.

CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 223 of 1959. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and ordered dated April 14, 1959, of the former Bombay High Court (Rajkot Branch) at Rajkot in Criminal Appeal No. 84 of 1958.

1962. January 24. The Judgment was delivered by KAPUR, J.-The appellant and two others were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gohilwad, under ss. 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code for the murder of Kanji and they were sentenced to imprisonment for life under the former section and to seven years' rigorous imprisonment under the latter. The sentence were concurrent. On appeal the High Court set aside the conviction of Nanji Ravji but upheld the convictions and sentences of the appellant and Karamshi Bhawan. The appellant has Come in appeal to this Court by Special leave.
The High Court rejected the confession of Karamshi on the ground that it was not voluntary. It acquitted Nanji on the ground that there were no corroboration in regard to him of the approver's statement, the place where the dead body was buried was not discovered at his instance, his production of stick and shirt and trousers from his house was of no consequence, and the oral evidence was contrary to the medical evidence and Karamshi's confessional statement could not be used against Nanji.
What the law requires in the case of an accomplice's evidence is that there should be such corroboration of the material Parts of the story connecting the accused with the crime as will satisfy reasonable minds that the approver can be regarded as a truthful witness. The corroboration need not be direct evidence of the commission of the offence by the accused. If it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime it will be sufficient and the nature of the corroboration will depend on and vary with the circumstances of each case. Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy v. The State of Hyderabad.
But there are other circumstances which have to be considered even if the evidence of the approver is held not to be very helpful to the prosecution. Firstly, there is the pointing out of the dead body by the appellant from the well; secondly, the discovery of the blood-stained (stained with human blood) buttons at the instance of the appellant i thirdly the scarf which has been held to belong to the appellant and which was found from the pit pointed out by the co-accused Nanji and fourthly by the presence of the hairs of the appellant and of the deceased on that scarf.
Thus, we have besides the evidence of the approver three important facts which connect the appellant with the commission of the offence. His pointing out the dead body, his pointing out the silver buttons of the deceased which were stained with human blood and the presence of his hairs on a pania (scarf) on which there were the hairs of the deceases also. In our opinion this would be sufficient evidence in the circumstances of the present case to connect the appellant with the commission of the offence.
