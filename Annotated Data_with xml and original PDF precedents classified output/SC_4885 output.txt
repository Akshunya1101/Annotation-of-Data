"At that time, there were six Custom Officers around me. In the gallery, I was again shown the 4 keys. I was again asked about the said keys and I had again given the same reply. The said officers on hearing this, got enraged and began to say that I was stating falsehoods. One of the officers, then asked me to take out my clothes. I had then worn one underwear and a pant and one bush coat and a ganji. I was then asked to remove my pant as well as my underwear by the said officer and I did so accordingly against my will. That officer then ordered me to sit in the position of "a chair". I was so asked to sit like a chair without the support of a wall even to my back. The six officers were then standing around me at that time. After making me to sit in that chair position they began to ask me about the said keys. I had again given the same reply about the said keys. If I moved a little from the position of a chair given to me, I was kicked by all the officers immediately. I was able to sit in that position for 4-5 minutes. I used to fall down thereafter. I used to be kicked therefor, made to stand again and asked to resume the same position. In this way, I had fallen and had been assaulted again and again by the said officers for about an hour or so. While I was so being questioned and made to sit in that position again and again one of the officers had gone out and had returned with a ruler in hand having a round shape. As I was made to sit in that position of a chair, I often used to move therefrom, the officers immediately used to assault me and I used to get up thereby. Out of the Customs Officers the officer who had the ruler in his hand used to assault me therewith, and the other officers used to assault me with kicks. I had been assaulted with that ruler on my left buttock, on my right buttock, on the back portion of the calf of my left leg, on my right thigh, on the backside of my both legs etc. I had received injuries at all these places stated by me above and as a result of this assault on me, I could not even stand up. Throughout the assault, I was being questioned again and again about the said keys by all the said officers and at every time I was stating that I did not know anything more about the same. Thereafter I had fallen down on the ground with my face towards the ground. All the said six officers then went away."
"The only explanation for this unusual attitude offered by him to the Court is that he was afraid of vendicative attitude from the officers. We have not been able to conceive how officers would have adopted any vindicative attitude when accused No. 15 was not concerned with any offence. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the complaint was not prosecuted and the evidence was recorded behind the back of the officers. It is not possible to hold on the present material that assaulting by the officers was for the purposes of extorting some confession and such assault alone was the cause of the injuries received by him. Beyond, therefore, creating a fog of suspicion, the injuries proved to have been caused to accused No. 15, cannot indicate that all the accused were subjected to torture, assault and pressure for giving statements to the liking of officers or compelling them to sign the prepared statements"
"From the 14th instant at 12 noon till about 3 p.m. I was locked up alone in one room with some Customs Officers who continuously interrogated me, theatened and physically assaulted me to make and sign a statement prepared by them after ascertaining a few personal questions from me pertaining to my family and myself. I was not allowed to sleep during the entire night of the 14th/15th and was not allowed to see any person. The statement was written out by the officers themselves in English language and it was not explained to me and my signature was obtained which I have signed in Gujrathi. As a result of this threat, coercion and complete exhaustion, I had no alternative but to sign the statement after which only I was allowed to rest."
