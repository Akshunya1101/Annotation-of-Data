The Judgment was delivered by SHAH J.
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the imposition of penalty under section 28(1)(c) of the Indian Income-tax Act, upon the petitioner-firm (respondent) as constituted at the time of levy of penalty was legal and valid ?"
"Where any business, profession or vocation carried on by a firm...has been discontinued, ...every person who was at the time of such discontinuance...a partner of such firm...shall, in respect of the income, profits and gains of the firm...be jointly and severally liable to assessment under Chapter IV and for the amount of tax payable and all the provisions of Chapter IV shall, so far as may be, apply to any such assessment."
"This section [section 44] only applies when there has been a discontinuance of the business, ... The section says that if a business is discontinued the partners shall nevertheless be jointly and severally liable for the profits which had been earned."
"Section 44 operates in two classes of cases: where there is discontinuance of business, profession or vocation carried on by a firm or association, and where there is dissolution of an association. It follows that mere dissolution of a firm without discontinuance of the business will not attract the application of section 44 of the Act.... The reason for this distinction appears from the scheme of the Income-tax Act in its relation to assessment of the income of a firm. A firm whether registered or unregistered is recognised under the Act as a unit of assessment [sections 3 and 2(2)], and its income is computed under clauses (3) and (4) of section 23 as the income of any other unit. Section 25(1) relates to assessment in case of a discontinued business--whether the business is carried on by a firm or by any other person....... Then there is the special provision relating to assessment when at the time of making an assessment it is found that a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm, or a firm has been newly constituted: section 26(1). The date on which the change has occurred is immaterial: it may be in the year of account, in the year of assessment or even after the close of the year of assessment. The Income-tax Officer has under section 26(1) to assess the firm as constituted at the time of making the assessment, but the income, profits and gains of the previous year have, for the purpose of inclusion in the total income of the partners, to be apportioned between the partners who were entitled to receive the same. Sub-section (2) of section 26 relates to assessment in the case of succession to a person (which expression includes a firm) carrying on a business by another person in such capacityDiscontinuance of business has the same connotation in section 44 as it has in section 25 of the Act; it does not cover mere change in ownership or in the constitution of the unit of assessment. Section 44 is, therefore, attracted only when the business of a firm is discontinued, i.e., when there is complete cessation of the business and not when there is a change in the ownership of the firm, or in its constitution, because by reconstitution of the firm, no change is brought about in the personality of the firm, and succession to the business and not discontinuance of the business results . . . . . . But the Income-tax Act recognises a firm for purposes of assessment as a unit independent of the partners constituting it; it invests the firm with a personality which survives re-constitution. A firm discontinuing its business may be assessed in the manner provided by section 25(1) in the year of account in which it discontinues its business; it may also be assessed in the year of assessment. In either case it is the assessment of the income of the firm. Where the firm is dissolved, but the business is not discontinued, there being change in the constitution of the firm, assessment has to be made under section 26(1), and if there be succession to the business, assessment has to be made under section 26(2). The provisions relating to assessment on re-constituted or newly constituted firms, and on succession to the business are obligatory. Therefore, even when there is change in the ownership of the business carried on by a firm on re-constitution or because of a new constitution, assessment must still be made upon the firm. When there is succession, the successor and the person succeeded have to be assessed each in respect of his actual share. This scheme of assessment furnishes the reason for omitting reference to dissolution of a firm from section 44 when such dissolution is not accompanied by discontinuance of the business."
