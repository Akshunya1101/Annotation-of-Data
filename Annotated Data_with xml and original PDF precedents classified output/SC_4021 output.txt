1962. January 18.-The Judgment was delivered by SHAH, J.-These are three appeals with certificates of fitness granted by the High Court of Madras against orders passed in Petitions for the issue of writs of certiorari setting aside orders imposing penalty upon the firm of Messrs. S. V. Veerappan Chettiar & Co. passed by the Income-tax Officer under s. 28(1)(c) of the Indian Income-tax Act.
"If the Income-tax Officer x x x x x x in the course of any proceedings under this Act is satisfied that any person- (a) has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return of his total income which he was required to furnish by notice given under sub- section (1) or sub-section (2) of section 22 or section 34 or has without reasonable cause failed to furnish it within the time allowed and in the manner required by such notice, or (b) has without reasonable cause failed to comply with a notice under subsection (4) of section 22 or sub- section (2) of section 23, or (c) has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of such income, he or it may direct that such persons shall by way of penalty, in the case referred to in clause (a), in addition to the amount of the income-tax and super-tax, if any, payable by him, a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount, and in the cases referred to in clauses (b) and (c), in addition to any tax- payable by him, a sum not exceeding one and a half times the amount of the income-tax and super-tax, if any, which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the correct income".The expression" person"is defined in s. 2(a) of the Act as including" a Hindu undivided family and a local authority"
"any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not."
"....................... even when construed by its own language the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) cannot be said to make it a condition precedent that a person must be liable to pay some income-tax or it may be also super-tax if he is to be made liable for a penalty. Clause (b) of the proviso to my mind emphasizes that meaning of the concluding paragraph of Section 28 (1) and rests on an assumption that under that provision a person may be chargeable to penalty although he may not be chargeable to tax."The learned Chief Justice also observed,"......it was not really necessary for clause (d) of the proviso to enact specifically that a registered firm would be liable to pay a penalty despite the fact that it could not be charged and was not, in fact, charged to income-tax or super-tax. The whole argument of Dr. Sen Gupta was that the concluding paragraph of Section 28 (1) had left a gap which had been attempted to be filled up by clause (d) of the proviso, but the attempt had not been successful. In my view the gap which undoubtedly existed in the concluding paragraph of section 28 (1) was only an absence of a provision regarding the quantum of the penalty that could be levied from a registered firm because the quantum depends upon the amount of income-tax payable"
