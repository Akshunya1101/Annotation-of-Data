Respondent had married the appellant, the Magistrate categorically said that the appellant and the respondent lived together as husband and wife for a number of years and appellant 2 Maroti was their child. If, as a matter of fact, a marriage although ineffective in the eye of law, took place between appellant 1 and respondent 1, the status of the boy must be held to be of a legitimate son on account of s. 16(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Even if the factum of marriage of this mother is ignored he must be treated as an illegitimate child of the respondent on the basis of the findings of the Judicial Magistrate and is entitled to relief by reason of cls. (b) and (c) of s. 125(1) of the Code specifically referring to an illegitimate child. Order of the Judicial Magistrate allowing the maintenance to appellant 2 was correctly passed
