"37. General.- (1) Any expenditure (not being expenditure of the nature described in Sections 30 to 36 and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee), laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession shall be allowed in computing the income chargeable under the head 'Profit and gains of business or profession'
"Provision for curbing avoidable or ostentatious expenditure in business or profession (Section 37). - Section 37 of the Income tax Act provides for deduction in the computation of taxable profits of any expenditure other than expenditure of the nature described in Sections 30 to 36 and Section 80-VV, or expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee, laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession carried on by the taxpayer. With a view to curbing certain categories of avoidable or ostentatious expenditure by assessees carrying on business or profession, the Finance Act has made certain amendments to Section 37 of the Income Tax Act. The substance of these amendments is explained in paragraphs 31 to 34 hereunderEntertainment expenditure. - 31.1 For the removal of doubts regarding the scope of the expression 'entertainment expenditure', the Finance Act has inserted a new Explanation for the purposes of sub-section (2-A) of Section 37 and also sub-section (2-B) of that section as that sub-section stood before 1-4-1977. The Explanation clarifies that 'entertainment expenditure' includes expenditure on provision of hospitality of every kind by the assessee to any person, whether by way of provision of food or beverages or in any other manner whatsoever and whether or not such provision is made by reason of any express or implied contract or custom, usage or trade. However, expenditure incurred in providing food or beverages by an employer to his employee in office, factory or other place or their work will not be regarded as entertainment expenditure

"... What we have to see is as to what is the meaning of the word 'entertainment' for purposes of Section 37(2-A) of the Act. In the Income Tax Act, this word has not been defined and we will have to give it its general meaning. An 'entertainment expenditure' would, in our opinion, include all expenditures incurred in connection with business on the entertainment of customer and constituents. The entertainment may consist of providing refreshments as in this case or it may consist of providing some other sort of entertainmentIn Bentleys, Stokes & Lowless v. Beeson (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) a firm of solicitors incurred expenses in entertaining clients. The entertainment consisted of providing lunch to the clients. It was held that expenditure was incurred wholly and exclusively for purposes of business and was an allowable deduction. The same is the position in the instant case. The petitioner has been providing to its customers refreshments and this constitutes an expenditure in the nature of 'entertainment expenditure'. The entire expenditure would have been allowed but for the amendment introduced by Section 37(2-A) which restricts the allowance of such an expenditure to a maximum limit of Rs 5000."
"... The Tribunal has agreed with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who has found that it was customary for the assessee due to very long-established tradition that farmers who came to deliver the goods, i.e., cotton, groundnuts, rice, pulses, were given meals from the kitchen run by the assessee and if the assessee failed to give this normal courtesy, it apprehended that the farmers might offer their produce to other competitors in the field of the assessee and the assessee would lose the goods. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner has also found that the expenditure was for serving ordinary meals to the employees as well as to the farmer customers and they were not such which entertained or amused the guests since the assessee provided/served meals as a bare necessity of the business. In that view of the matter, therefore, these references must be rejected and we answer the questions referred to us in the negative and against the Commissioner, ...."
"The declaration and the clarification involved in Explanation 2, are only for the purposes of assessments with effect from April 1, 1976. This provision widens the concept of 'entertainment expenditure' by including in its scope such of the expenditures which are otherwise traditionally understood as routine business expenditures incurred in connection with 'business-hospitality'. Therefore, the widened meaning cannot be extended to past period when the amended Explanation 2 was not in operation."
