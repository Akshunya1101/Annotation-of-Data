"it would appear that the work which had till then been done by the Chairman was to be transferred to the Member and approval of the Secretary to the Government of India was obtained for this transfer or allocation of work."The High Court, however, found that the averments in the affidavit were" not in line"
"M (I & ED) may also consider whether he could take up the cases for sanction of reopening of assessments (old section 34)."
"Rule 4 of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (Regulation of Transaction of Business) Rules, 1964, envisage that the Chairman may by an order made with the previous approval of the Central Government distribute the business of the Board among himself and the other Members. Accordingly, the office Order already issued in the matter will require amendment. Draft D. O. is submitted for consideration. We may also inform the Heads of Departments under the Board about the decision. Draft letter is submitted for approval."The last relevant note on this subject reads
"changing the allocation with the previous approval of the Central Government, the sanction as granted by Shri S. A. L. Narayana Row is without jurisdiction and authority."
"Discussed with Secy. (R & E). It is just a minor internal arrangement. No formal order is necessary."
"derived from records in the possession of the Central Board of Direct Taxes"and by Shri P. G. Gandhi as" based on the information derived from record in possession of the Board"
