The Judgment was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.
"On October 9, 1948, the assessee company purchased 15, 547 shares at Rs. from Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd., and the amount 400 per share paid by the assessee company was adjusted towards the purchase price and the balance was paid. On the same day, the remaining 11, 000 shares were sold by Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. to National Construction and Development Corporation Ltd., at Rs. 400 per share. Thus, on that date Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. ceased to have any connection with the present matter. It may be pointed out that on the date on which the two transactions took place, the price ruling in the market was about Rs. 217-8-0. Before Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. parted with the shares, they had appointed a new Board of Directors of the Madhusudan Mills Ltd., and these new directors also belonged to the same group. The managing agency of Messrs Bhadani Brothers Ltd., was terminated, and on the same day on which the shares were purchased from these managing agents, the assessee company was appointed as the purchasing and selling agent of the Mills. The assessee company made enormous profits from the acquisition of these shares by way of dividend and commission as the purchasing and selling agent. In October and November, 1948, they, however, sold 6, 525 shares to Dalmia Cement and Marketing Company Ltd. at Rs. 400 per share. These shares subsequently came back to the same group; but that is not a matter with which we are immediately concernedOn April 7, 1949, 4, 500 shares were sold by the assessee company to the National Investment Trust Ltd. at Rs. 181 per share resulting in a loss of Rs. 8, 80, 000 and on June 1, 1949, another block of 3, 000 shares was sold to the National Investment Trust Ltd. at Rs. 180 per share, resulting in a loss of Rs. 5, 86, 312. We are not concerned with the loss arising from the first sale which was considered in the assessment year, 1950-51, and in respect of which a reference is pending in the High Court of Punjab. We are concerned with the loss in the second year relating to the assessment year, 1951-52. In that year, the loss on the sale of the shares was sought to be set off against the profits made, and the loss practically cancelled the profits. The shares which were sold by the assessee company on the two occasions were sold to one Amrit Bhushan (a relative of Mr. Yodh Raj Bballa) who sold them the same day to Messrs. National Investment Trust Ltd. at the slender profit of 8 annas per share, which was brokerage. Thus, at the beginning and at the end, though numerous transactions had taken place, the shares continued to be the property of the "Yodh Raj Bhalla group". The question is whether the loss on the sale of the shares can be set off against the profits in the year in which the sales and profits were respectively made
"The learned Chief Justice then considered the argument that a block of shares might have to be bought, if at all, at a higher price, and observed as follows"
"Messrs. Ramnarain and Sons Ltd. then appealed to this court, and the decision of the Bombay High Court was upheld. The judgment of this court is reported in Ramnarain Sons (Pr.) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax ? It was laid down by this court that in considering whether a transaction was or was not an adventure in the nature of trade, the problem must be approached in the light of the intention of the assessee, having regard to the"
"Dealing with the price above the market price, which was paid in that case, it was observed"
