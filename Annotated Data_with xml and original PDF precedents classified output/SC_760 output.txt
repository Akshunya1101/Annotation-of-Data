The Court of the Additional Judge is not a division Court of the Court of the District Judge but a separate and distinct Court of its own. The Senior Subordinate Judge who made the complaint had no jurisdiction to make it, either as the original Court which tried the suit, or as the appellate authority under section 476-B of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is not enough that he also had first class powers because he was not the same Court. As the High Court was neither the original Court nor the Court to which the original Court was subordinate, according to the special definition in section 195(3), it had no jurisdiction to make the complaint of its own authority. - Wadero Abdul Rahman vs. Sadhuram (1930) 32 CrLJ 1012 & M.S. Sheriff vs. Govindan (AIR 1951 Mad 1060, 1061) not approved.
Criminal Appeal No. 34 of 1955. (Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 7th June 1954 of the Punjab High Court at Simla in Criminal Revision No. 985 of 1953 arising out of the judgment and order dated the 9th May 1953 of the Court of the Additional District Judge, Ambala.), decided on February 15, 1956.
The Judgment was delivered by BOSE J. :
"the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of section 195, sub-section (3)"
"For the purposes of this section, a Court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the appealable decrees or sentences of such former Court, or in the case of a Civil Court from whose decrees no appeal ordinarily lies to the principal court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction within the local limits of whose jurisdiction such Civil Court is situate"
[A. I. R. 1951 Mad. 1060
1951 AIR(Mad) 1060
"The jurisdiction to be exercised in civil suits as regards the value by any person appointed to be a Subordinate Judge shall be determined by the High Court either by including him in a class or otherwise as it thinks fit"
"that appeals lying to the District Court from all or any of the decrees or orders passed in an original suit by any Subordinate Judge shall be preferred to such other Subordinate Judge as may be mentioned in the notification"
"shall be preferred to the Senior Subordinate Judge of the first class exercising jurisdiction within such Civils District"
"the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the appealable decrees or sentences of such former Court"
"where appeals lie to a Civil and also to a Revenue Court, such Court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the Civil or Revenue Court according to the nature of the case or proceeding"

"This appears to regard each Senior Subordinate Judge as a Court in himself and not merely as the presiding officer of the Court of the Subordinate Judge.
"Now this permits an appeal from one Subordinate Judge to another and the words the "Court of such other Subordinate Judge" indicate that the Subordinate Judge to whom the appeal is preferred is a separate and distinct Court.
