Criminal Appeal No. 174 of 1961. (Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 12/13, 1961, of the Bombay High Court in Cr. A. No. 308 of 1961.), decided on August 29, 1962.
The Judgment was delivered by :
"An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice"
"The court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars"
 1944 Mad. 308
1944 Mad 308
"Their Lordships......................... would nevertheless observe that Courts should be slow to depart from the rule of prudence, based on long experience, which requires some independent evidence, implicating the particular accused. The danger of acting upon accomplice evidence is not merely that the accomplice is on his own admission a man of bad character who took part in the offence and afterwards to save himself betrayed his former associates, and who has placed himself in a position in which he can hardly fail to have a strong bias in favour of the prosecution; the real danger is that he is telling a story which in its general outline is true, and it is easy for him to work into the story matter which is untrue"

"There is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law (R. v. Attwood, 1787, Leach 464). But it has been long a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, and in the discretion of the Judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence, but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence (R. v. Stubbs, Dears 555; In re Heunier, 1894 2 Q.B. 415)"
