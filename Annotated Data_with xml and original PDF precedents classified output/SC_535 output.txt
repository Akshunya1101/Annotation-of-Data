HELD: That the expression "sales of goods" in Entry 48 has the same meaning which it had in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, that in a building contract there is no sale of materials as such, and that it is therefore ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature to impose tax on the supply of materials.

The Order of the Court is as follows
"any agreement for carrying out for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of any building, road, bridge or other immovable property or the installation or repair of any machinery affixed to a building or other immovable property ". Section 2(c) of the Act defines" dealer"
"all materials, articles and commodities whether or not to be used in the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of immovable property ". Section 2(g) defines sale" as follows: "" Sale"
"as including the amount payable to a dealer as valuable consideration for the carrying out of any contract, less such portion, representing the proportion of the cost of labour to the cost of materials, used in carrying out such contract, as may be prescribed. "Turnover" is defined in s. 2(j) as including the aggregate amount of the sale price received or receivable by a dealer in respect of the supply of goods in the carrying out of any contract. The charging section is s. 4(a), and it provides that dealers whose turnover exceeded certain limits shall be liable to pay tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act on all sales effected after the commencement of the Act. Rule 4 of the Sales Tax Rules, 1947, provides that"
", and then follows a scale of percentages to be allowed in respect of different classes of contracts.Acting on these provisions, the authorities constituted under the Act called upon the contractors within the State to furnish returns in respect of their receipts from contract works for the purpose of assessment of sales tax, to which the appellants replied by instituting the proceedings, out of which the present appeals arise. The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 253 of 1955 is a contractor doing business in the construction of buildings and roads for the Military and Public Works Department in the State of Madhya Pradesh, and he filed M. P. No. 245 of 1954 challenging the validity of the assessment which the respondents proposed to make, on two grounds. He contended firstly that the Provincial Legislature had authority under Entry 48 of List 11, Sch. VII of the Government of India Act, 1935, to impose tax only on sale of goods, that the supply of materials in works contracts was not a sale within that Entry, and that the provisions of the Act, which sought to impose a tax thereon treating it as a sale, were therefore ultra vires; and secondly that he was entitled to exemption under item 33 in Sch. 11 to the Act as enacted by Act XVI of 1949, and that the notification of the Government dated September 18, 1950, withdrawing that exemption was unconstitutional and void. To appreciate this contention, it is necessary to refer to s. 6 of the Act, which is as follows: 6 (1)"
"In exercise of the power conferred by s. 6 (2) of the Act, the State issued a notification on September 18, 1950, amending item 33 by substituting for the words "Goods sold to or by the State Government" the words "Goods sold by the State Government". The resultant position is that the appellant who was entitled to exemption under Act XVI of 1949 in respect of goods sold to the Government could no longer claim it by reason of the notification aforesaid. Now, the ground of his attack was that it was not open to the Government in exercise of the authority delegated to it under s. 6 (2) of the Act to modify or alter what the Legislature had enacted. The appellant accordingly claimed that the proceedings which the respondents proposed to take for assessment of sales tax were incompetent, and prayed that an appropriate writ might be issued restraining them from proceeding with the same. In Civil Appeal No. 254 of 1955, the appellants are the Jabalpur Contractors' Association, which is a registered body and certain contractors, and they filed M. P. No. 279 of 1954 questioning the validity of the proposed assessment on the same grounds as in M. P. No. 245 of 1954. The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 255 of 1955, is the Madhya Pradesh Contractors' Association, Nagpur, which is again a registered body, and it filed M. P. No. 305 of 1954, challenging the legality of the proceedings for assessment on the same grounds as in M. P. No. 245 of 1954.All these three petitions were heard together, and by their judgment dated November 30, 1954, the learned Judges held that the expression "sale of goods" in Entry 48 was wide enough to coverall transactions in which property in the moveables passed from one person to another for money, and that, accordingly, in a building contract there was a sale within Entry 48 of the materials used therein, and that the provisions of the Act imposing tax thereon were valid. But the learned Judges also held that the tax could be levied only on the actual value of the materials to be determined on an enquiry into the matter, and that the definition of "price" in s. 2 (h) (ii) and r. 4 framed pursuant thereto were ultra vires in that they laid down artificial rules for fixing the same by deducting certain percentages from out of the total receipts on account of labour. As regards the notification dated September 18, 1950, the learned Judges held that it was within the authority conferred by the statute and was valid. In the result, the impugned provisions of the Act were held to be valid except as to the definition of "price" in s. 2 (h) (ii) and r. 4 of the Sales Tax Rules, 1947. It is against this judgment that the above appeals have been preferred on a certificate granted by the High Court under Art. 132(1) of the Constitution.

"On these observations, the point for determination is whether the impugned notification relates to what may be said to be an essential feature of the law, and whether it involves any change of policy. Now, the authorities are clear that it is not unconstitutional for the legislature to leave it to the executive to determine details relating to the working of taxation laws, such as the selection of persons on whom the tax is to be laid, the rates at which it is to be charged in respect of different classes of goods, and the like.
