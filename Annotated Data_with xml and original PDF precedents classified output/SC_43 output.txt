HELD: That the Rules framed under S. 26A quite clearly show that a minor who is admitted to the benefits of partnership need not sign- the application for registration.. The law requires all partners to sign the application, and if the definition were to be carried to the extreme, even a minor who is admitted to the benefits of partnership would be competent to sign such an application. The definition is designed to confer equal benefits upon the minor by treating him as a partner; but it does not render a minor a competent and full partner. For that purpose, the law of Partnership must be considered, apart from the definition in the Income-tax Act.
