HELD: Applying the principle of law under s. 38 of the Penal Code, the case of Bhaba Nanda can be separated from that of his two brothers. He shared their common intention to assault, with the knowledge that it was likely to result in death but while committing the act in furtherance of that common intention, the other two developed and shared the common intention of causing the murder. Bhaba Nanda can, therefore, be held guilty only u/s. 304 Part 11 while the other two appellants are liable for the murder with the aid of s. 34 of the Penal Code. [717 G-H, 718 A-B]
