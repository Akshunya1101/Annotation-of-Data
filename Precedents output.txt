Civil Appeal : 08 03 2021 SC 825 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : 10. However, in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618, a seven-Judge Bench overruled this view and held that the power to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11 is judicial and not administrative. The conclusions of the seven-Judge Bench were summarised in para 47 of the aforesaid judgment. We are concerned directly with sub-paras (i), (iv) and (xii), which read as follows: (SCC pp. 663-64)

Civil Appeal : 13 01 2021 SC 1322-1323 of 2019.xml : Precedent : 9.3. The CTO further held that the goods must be treated as having crossed the customs frontiers of India when the bill of entry was made and the goods were assessed to customs duty; and the sale effected by the appellant could not be said to be sale in the course of import or high seas sale inasmuch as the goods had crossed the customs frontiers. The CTO reiterated that the second high seas sale agreement had not come into operation; and there was no case for claiming that the transfer of documents was effected by virtue of the said agreement itself. With reference to the facts of the case and the relevant case-law, the CTO held that the sale in fact took place only after customs clearance and proceeded to overrule the contentions of the appellant. The CTO, inter alia, observed and held as under:

Civil Appeal : 10 03 2021 SC 843-844 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : The amendments to Section 11 were brought in to legislatively overrule the line of judgments including SBP & Co., Boghara Polyfab, Master Construction, etc., which had enlarged the scope of power of the appointing authority to decide various issues at the pre-reference stage.

Civil Appeal : 10 03 2021 SC 843-844 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : "10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down by this Court, which would have included going into whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has now been legislatively overruled. This being the position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid judgment [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785], as Section 11(6-A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been laid down in the judgment in Duro Felguera, SA [Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729"

Civil Appeal : 10 03 2021 SC 843-844 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : In paragraph 144, the Court observed that the judgment in Mayavati Trading had rightly held that the judgment in Patel Engineering had been legislatively overruled.

Civil Appeal : 10 03 2021 SC 843-844 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : "144. As observed earlier, Patel Engg. Ltd. explains and holds that Sections 8 and 11 are complementary in nature as both relate to reference to arbitration. Section 8 applies when judicial proceeding is pending and an application is filed for stay of judicial proceeding and for reference to arbitration. Amendments to Section 8 vide Act 3 of 2016 have not been omitted. Section 11 covers the situation where the parties approach a court for appointment of an arbitrator. Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd., in our humble opinion, rightly holds that Patel Engg. Ltd. has been legislatively overruled and hence would not apply even post omission of sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. has elaborated upon the object and purposes and history of the amendment to Section 11, with reference to sub-section (6-A) to elucidate that the section, as originally enacted, was facsimile with Article 11 of the Uncitral Model of law of arbitration on which the Arbitration Act was drafted and enacted."

Civil Appeal : 24 03 2021 SC 3395 OF 2020.xml : Precedent : 47.1. The NCLT noticed that as per the said CA, the concessionaire (JIL) was to bear the acquisition cost for the project land given to it and in consideration, the concessionaire would obtain the right to develop land for commercial exploitation and the right to operate the Expressway and collect toll for a period of 36 years; and after the expiry of 36 years from the grant of concession, the Expressway shall revert to YEIDA. As to the land for development, it was given on lease for 90 years. It was essentially submitted on behalf of YEIDA that the question, of additional compensation of the land acquired, cropped up with the directions of the Allahabad High Court; and that the liability in regard to the additional compensation in relation to the land acquired and leased to JIL was that of the corporate debtor JIL. It was also pointed out that the question of such additional compensation by JIL was subjected to arbitration proceedings where an award was made to the effect that the corporate debtor need not pay this amount of additional compensation but the award has been questioned by YEIDA in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 Hereinafter also referred as to 'the Arbitration Act'.-It appears from the corrigendum dated 17.03.2020 and the submissions of the parties that the issue is pending before the Court of District Judge, Gautam Budh Nagar. YEIDA stated its objection to the stipulation in the resolution plan that in case of the award being overruled, YEIDA would collect the amount of additional compensation from the end-users of the project land. It was submitted in this regard that in the CA, two payment components were present - one being of acquisition cost payable by the concessionaire and another being of lease rent, which could be paid by the sub-lessee/end-user as the case may be. It was submitted that given such components, the IRP or the resolution applicant could not insist that YEIDA has to collect the acquisition cost directly from the end-users. It was also submitted that even if the land utilised for Expressway was to revert to YEIDA after 36 years, the CA nevertheless provided as key components that the concessionaire would collect toll for this period and has to bear all the cost including the cost of acquisition; and there was no exemption as regards the land of Expressway. It was also submitted that the resolution applicant cannot split the transferred land into two and say that the payment of additional compensation would be applicable to the land used for development alone. It was further submitted that in view of Clause 18.1 of CA, in case of the necessity to transfer the concessionaire's rights and obligations to an SPV, there has to be necessary documentation involving YEIDA, the concessionaire and the SPV incorporated, so that YEIDA could keep exercising its rights over the SPV concerned; and the resolution applicant or CoC could not have unilaterally transferred the rights and obligations of the corporate debtor to an SPV without the consent of YEIDA. A decision of this Court in the case of Embassy Property Development Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka and Ors.: 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1542 was also referred to submit that IBC will not have overriding effect on every enactment which is applicable to the transactions related to the corporate debtor. It was further submitted that the requirement of withdrawal of arbitration case could not be thrust upon YEIDA under the cover of the plan; and for the resolution plan having set out so many provisions curtailing the rights held by YEIDA, the same was required to be rejected. However, the Adjudicating Authority also noticed that despite such objections, the counsel appearing on behalf of YEIDA submitted that since the project was for public cause, it would have no objection for approval of the resolution plan provided necessary changes were made in it 'by removing the fall outs from the concession agreement'.

Civil Appeal : 24 03 2021 SC 3395 OF 2020.xml : Precedent : (i) As mentioned in this Plan, this Resolution Plan assumes that no amount is payable by the Corporate Debtor in relation to the Landowner Compensation Debt in view of the Award. However, if the said position changes on account of the Award being overruled then in relation to the Landowner Compensation Debt, the amounts payable to the landowners shall be collected directly by YEIDA in the following manner for the following parcels of lands (in relation to which such debt accrues), from the ultimate end-users:

Civil Appeal : 12 02 2021 SC 1844 OF 2010.xml : Precedent : 2.1. That, as per the case of the original plaintiff, the respondents herein - original defendants (hereinafter referred to as the 'original defendants') borrowed a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- from the father of the appellant herein - original plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as the 'original plaintiff') in the year 1990 by way of a simple mortgage deed and then further Rs. 50,000/- by way of a promissory note in the year 1992. The deed of simple mortgage was executed on 11.07.1990. The mortgage deed was executed between the original defendants as Mortgager and one partnership firm namely C.H. Shantilal & Co. as Mortgagee. The original plaintiff is the son of Shri C.H. Shantilal who was one of the partners of the firm which was dissolved on 17.12.1994. That, as per the case of the original plaintiff, the mortgager borrowed a loan of Rs. 1,00,000/- from mortgagee in order to clear their earlier debt in lieu of mortgage of property - suit property. That the mortgager was to repay Rs. 1,00,000/- to the mortgagee within a period of 5 years from the day the deed was entered into along with interest at the rate of 1.5% per mensem or 18% per annum. That the interest was required to be paid by the mortgagers to the mortgagee every month on or before the 10th of each month. According to the original plaintiff, in the event of failure to pay the principal or interest within the period, the mortgagee will be entitled to enforce the said mortgage and cause the property or any portion sold and appropriate the proceeds towards the satisfaction of the mortgage deed. A promissory note was also executed by the original defendants while taking a further sum of Rs. 50,000/- on 13.12.1992 and created a further charge in the mortgaged property. That, as the defendants-mortgagers did not pay the aforesaid amount, the plaintiff filed a suit being O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 on 30.5.1995 before the Court of learned City Civil Judge at Bangalore for a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- together with interest thereon. It was also further prayed that on failure of the defendants to pay the decretal amount, the plaintiff shall be at liberty to sell the mortgaged property and the sale considerations so realized to be adjusted over the decretal amount. According to the plaintiff, the defendants filed a written statement on 31.05.1995 and admitted borrowing of Rs. 1,50,000/-. According to the plaintiff, the defendants were represented by an Advocate. A Compromise/Settlement was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants on 01.06.1995. The defendants agreed to pay to the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- in a monthly installment of Rs. 5,000/- within three years. Learned Trial Court accordingly decreed the suit in terms of the compromise vide judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995. That the plaintiff filed an execution petition being Execution Petition No. 232 of 1996 before the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore on 28.02.1996. The judgment debtor-defendant entered appearance through an advocate on 21.06.1996 in the execution petition. That the judgment debtor-defendant filed objections in the execution petition and contended that the decree dated 01.06.1995 was obtained by fraud. By order dated 03.03.1998, the Executing Court overruled the objections of the judgment debtor-defendant and specifically observed that the objections of the judgment debtor that the decree has been obtained by fraud, mis-representation etc., are overruled. By overruling the objections raised by the judgment debtor, learned Executing Court specifically observed that the judgment debtor has failed to lead any evidence in support of his objections that the decree was obtained by fraud or mis-representation. That, thereafter, learned Executing Court issued sale proclamation of the mortgaged property on 21.11.1998. The mortgaged property was put to sale by the Executing Court. The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845 of 2010 was declared the highest bidder. He deposited 25% of the bid amount on 11.02.1999 itself on the day on which the sale was conducted. The auction purchaser offered Rs. 4,50,000/- and his bid was accepted by the Executing Court. After the bid of the auction purchaser was accepted, the judgment debtors filed I.A. No. 03 of 1999 on 19.02.1999 in the Execution Petition under Section 151 C.P.C. before the learned Additional City Civil Judge (Executing Court) to stay further proceedings with regard to sale of the subject mortgaged property. On 22.02.1999, the judgment debtors filed another I.A. No. 04 of 1999 in the Execution Petition under Order XXI read with Rule 90 and Order XXI read with Rule 47 and Section 151 CPC to set aside the court auction/sale dated 11.02.1999 and 18.02.1999 with respect to the subject mortgaged property. By order dated 30.10.1999 the learned Executing Court dismissed both the aforesaid applications. While dismissing I.A. No. 3 of 1999, the learned Executing Court observed that the earlier order dated 03.03.1998 was a speaking order and the objections raised by the judgment debtors were overruled and the same had attained the finality as the same has not been assailed by the judgment debtor before any competent Appellate Forum. Learned Executing Court also further observed that the Executing Court cannot go behind the decree so as to decide the question of correctness and validity of the decree, when the decree has become final. The learned Executing Court dismissed I.A. No. 04 of 1999 on the ground that the judgment debtors have not deposited the decretal amount of Rs. 4,50,000/- together with interest in terms of Order XXI Rule 90 and therefore it does not entitle them to any relief for setting aside the sale as per the requirement of Order XXI Rule 90. That, thereafter, the sale of the mortgaged property came to be confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser on 17.11.1999. Sale certificate was issued by the Court in favour of the auction purchaser and the sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar on 23.11.1999. That the judgment debtors thereafter on 24.11.1999 filed Civil Revision Application No. 3699 of 1999 before the High Court against the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the learned Executing Court in I.A. No. 4 of 1999 which was thereafter converted into MFA No. 3934 of 2000. The judgment debtors thereafter filed another Civil Revision Application No. 3700 of 1999 in the High Court against the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the learned Executing Court in I.A. No. 3 of 1999. The High Court vide its order dated 06.01.2000 dismissed Civil Revision Application No. 3700 of 1999 by observing that the issue regarding fraud has attained finality as the order dated 03.03.1998 passed by the learned Executing Court overruling the objections of the judgment debtor had attainted finality and the same remained unchallenged. Having realized that the judgment debtors were required to challenge the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections, thereafter, after a period of two years from date of the order dated 03.03.1998, the judgment debtors filed Civil Revision Application No. 3297 of 2000 before the High Court. Thereafter and having realized that non-challenging of the judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995 passed by the learned Trial Court in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 shall come in their way, after a period of five years from the date of passing the judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995, the judgment debtors filed an appeal being RFA no. 274 of 2001 in the High Court. The said appeal was preferred in the year 2001. It is the case on behalf of the plaintiff that before the High Court a Compromise Petition was prepared on 10.06.2004 wherein the judgment debtors agreed to pay Rs. 6,96,062/- in full and final settlement of the decree passed by the learned Trial Court. However, at the time of filing of the Compromise Petition, the judgment debtors withdrew from the compromise agreed by them. Thereafter, the aforesaid first appeal proceeded further. The High Court vide order dated 19.09.2005 called for a finding/report from the Principal City Civil Judge and directed him to hold an enquiry as to whether the decree passed in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 was obtained by fraud. The propriety and legality of the said order of calling for a report/finding from the learned Principal City Civil Judge shall be dealt with hereinafter at an appropriate stage. That the learned Principal City Civil Judge submitted the report dated 06.12.2005 before the High Court wherein he recorded the finding that the decree in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 had been obtained by fraud. Relying upon the report submitted by the Principal City Civil Judge dated 06.12.2005 and having opined that the decree in O.S. No. 3376 of 1995 was obtained by fraud, the High Court vide its impugned judgment and order dated 16.09.2006 has allowed the appeals being RFA No. 274 of 2001, MFA No. 3934 of 2000 and CRP No. 3297 of 2000 and the operative part of the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court is as under:

Civil Appeal : 12 02 2021 SC 1844 OF 2010.xml : Precedent : 8.1 That the learned Trial Court passed the consent decree on 01.06.1995 and decreed that the defendants shall pay to the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- in a monthly installment of Rs. 5,000/- within three years from that day. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the execution of the simple mortgage deed, execution of the promissory note and taking the amounts of loan, have not been disputed by the judgment debtors. That, after the consent decree was passed on 01.06.1995, the judgment creditor-original plaintiff filed an execution petition before the Additional City Civil Judge, Bangalore, being Execution Petition No. 232 of 1996 on 28.02.1996. The judgment debtors entered appearance through an Advocate in the execution petition on 21.06.1996. Therefore, at least, it can be said that the judgment debtors were aware of the consent decree at least on 21.06.1996. Instead of challenging the said consent decree on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, the judgment debtors filed their objections in the execution petition contending that it was obtained by fraud. Such objections were filed on 04.10.1996. Learned Executing Court by a reasoned order dated 03.03.1998 overruled the objections of the judgment debtors that the decree has been obtained by fraud, mis-representation etc., by specifically observing that after filing of the objections, the matter was being posted for hearing, but the judgment debtors did not either adduce any evidence in that behalf nor have they addressed any arguments also and, therefore, in the absence of any proof of the allegation of fraud etc. made by the judgment debtors, the objections have to be overruled. That the judgment debtors did not challenge the order dated 03.03.1998 before the higher forum. Thereafter, after a period of eight months from the passing of the order dated 03.03.1998, the learned Executing Court issued the sale proclamation of the mortgaged property on 21.11.1998. The spot sale was held on 11.02.1999. The auction purchaser-appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1845 of 2010 was declared as the highest bidder. He deposited 25% of the bid amount. After his bid was accepted being the highest bidder, the Executing Court confirmed the sale/bid on 18.02.1999. Thereafter, judgment debtors filed I.A. No. 03 of 1999 before the Executing Court for stay of further proceedings in respect of sale of the subject mortgaged property. Judgment debtors also filed I.A. No. 4 of 1999 under Order XXI Rule 90 read with Rule 47 CPC before the Executing Court for setting aside Court sale in respect of the subject mortgaged property. The learned Executing Court dismissed both the aforesaid applications. Learned Executing Court dismissed I.A. No. 3 of 1999 by observing that the order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections filed by the judgment debtors has attained the finality as the same has not been assailed before any appellate forum and that the Executing Court cannot go behind the decree so as to decide the question of correctness and validity of the decree, when the decree had become final. The learned Executing Court dismissed I.A. No. 4 of 1999 on the ground that the judgment debtors have not deposited the decretal amount of Rs. 4,50,000/- together with interest in terms of Order XXI Rule 90 and therefore the judgment debtors are not entitled to seek for setting aside of the sale as per the requirement of Order XXI Rule 90. That, thereafter the learned Executing Court confirmed the sale in favour of the auction purchaser on 17.11.1999. On 23.11.1999, the sale certificate was issued by the court in favour of the auction purchaser and the sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar. That, after the sale was confirmed and the sale certificate was issued in favour of the auction purchaser and after the sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar, the judgment debtors filed Civil Revision Petition No. 3699 of 1999 in the High Court of Karnataka against the order dismissing I.A. No. 4 of 1999, which was thereafter converted into MFA No. 3934 of 2000. Thereafter the judgment debtors also filed Civil Revision Petition No. 3700 of 1999 in the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore against the order dated 30.10.1999 passed by the Executing Court. Civil Revision Petition No. 3700 of 1999 came to be dismissed by the High Court by an order dated 06.01.2000 holding that the issue that the decree was obtained by fraud has attained finality in view of order dated 03.03.1998 rejecting the objections of the judgment debtors remained unchallenged. That, thereafter, after the lapse of around two years, the judgment debtors challenged the order dated 03.03.1998 by filing CRP No. 3297 of 2000. At this stage, it is required to be noted that till this time judgment debtors did not challenge the decree dated 01.06.1995 before the High Court. That, after a period of five years from the date of passing of the judgment and decree dated 01.06.1995 the judgment debtors preferred RFA No. 274 of 2001 challenging the decree dated 01.06.1995 passed by the learned Trial Court on the ground that the same has been obtained by fraud and mis-representation. After a period of five years from the date of filing of the appeal, the High Court called for a finding/report from the learned Principal City Civil Judge and directed him to hold an enquiry as to whether the decree dated 01.06.1995 was obtained by fraud. The legality and propriety of the said order shall be dealt with hereinbelow at an appropriate stage. Before the learned Principal City Civil Judge, the judgment debtors led the evidence in support of their claim that the judgment and decree was obtained by fraud and mis-representation, which evidence was not led by them before the Executing Court when they submitted the objections and contended that the decree was obtained by fraud. That, thereafter, the learned Principal City Civil Judge submitted the report that the decree was obtained by fraud and on the basis of the report submitted by learned Principal City Civil Judge mainly, the High Court has set aside the judgment and decree by the impugned judgment and order. Thus, from the aforesaid it is crystal clear that all through-out there was a delay and negligence on the part of the judgment debtors in not initiating the appropriate proceedings at appropriate stage. Order dated 03.03.1998 overruling the objections submitted by the judgment debtors to the effect that the judgment was obtained by fraud and mis-representation was not challenged by the judgment debtors till the mortgaged property was auctioned; sale of the mortgaged property was confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser and even the sale certificate was issued in favour of the auction purchaser and sale was registered with the Sub-Registrar and even also the dismissal of I.A. No. 3 of 1999 and I.A. No. 4 of 1999. Not only that, till that time even no appeal was assailed/challenged before the higher forum. The first appeal was filed in the year 2000 and by that time the mortgaged property was already sold in the execution proceedings and the sale was confirmed in favour of the auction purchaser and even the sale certificate was issued in favour of the auction purchaser.

Civil Appeal : 25 03 2021 SC 1007 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : 75. By virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution, the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Umadevi (2006) 4 SCC 1 is binding on all the courts including this Court till the same is overruled by a larger Bench. The ratio of the Constitution Bench judgment has been followed by different two-Judge Benches for declining to entertain the claim of regularisation of service made by ad hoc/temporary/daily-wage/casual employees or for reversing the orders of the High Court granting relief to such employees - Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Workmen (2007) 1 SCC 408, Gangadhar Pillai v. Siemens Ltd. (2007) 1 SCC 533, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. L.V. Subramanyeswara (2007) 5 SCC 326, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. Dan Bahadur Singh (2007) 6 SCC 207. However, in U.P. SEB v. Pooran Chandra Pandey (2007) 11 SCC 92 on which reliance has been placed by Shri Gupta, a two-Judge Bench has attempted to dilute the Constitution Bench judgment by suggesting that the said decision cannot be applied to a case where regularisation has been sought for in pursuance of Article 14 of the Constitution and that the same is in conflict with the judgment of the seven-Judge Bench in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248."

Civil Appeal : 19 03 2021 SC 995 OF 2021.xml : Precedent : For all these reasons, given the illuminating arguments made in these appeals, we are of the view that N.V. International (supra) has been wrongly decided and is therefore overruled.
